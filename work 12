# Histogram: read the documentation for the hist() function that makes a histogram.
# a. Make a histogram of the ratings for the top 250 movies. Using the argument main, set the title
# of the histogram to be “Histogram of Ratings” and the label on the x-axis as “Ratings”.


hist(x = Data$ratings,main = "Histogram of Ratings" , xlab = "Rating", ylab = "No. of Movies")



# b. Make the histogram again so that the bars are white in color.

hist(x = Data$ratings,main = "Histogram of Ratings" , xlab = "Rating", ylab = "No. of Movies" , col = "white")




# Do the following
# i. Do par(mfrow = c(1,2) to make two plots next to each other. c(1,2) means 1 row, 2
#    columns.


par(mfrow = c(1,2))

# ii. Make a histogram of ratings and unweighted next to each other.



hist(x = Data$ratings,main = "Histogram of Ratings" , xlab = "Rating", ylab = "No. of Movies")
hist(x = Data$unweighted,main = "Histogram of Unweigthed Ratings" , xlab = "Unweighted Rating", ylab = "No. of Movies")





# iii. Use option xlim = c(7.5, 10) to define the limits on the x-axis.
hist(x = Data$unweighted,main = "Histogram of Unweigthed Ratings" , xlab = "Unweighted Rating", ylab = "No. of Movies", xlim = c(7.5 , 10))

# v. Are both data points positively or negatively skewed?
#    Both are positive skewed




## Using functions mean and median, calculate the sample mean and sample median for both
## variables and add vertical lines using function abline() on the plot.

abline(v = median(Data$ratings), col = 'blue', lwd = 2, lty = 'dashed' )
legend(x = 9,y = 100 ,legend = c("Mean","Meadian") ,lty = 'dashed', col = c("red" , "blue"))

# vii. What is the modal class?




# e. Using function var, find the sample variance of both ratings and unweighted.
var(Data$ratings)
var(Data$unweighted)
